### **Step 3: Run the Git Commands**

Now, in your terminal, run these commands one by one. I have already filled in your specific repository details for you.

1.  **Initialize a Git repository in your project folder:**
    ```powershell
    git init -b main
    ```

2.  **Add all your files for the first commit.** (The `.gitignore` file will make sure the secret and large folders are skipped).
    ```powershell
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Save a snapshot of your project with a message:**
    ```powershell
    git commit -m "Initial commit of the secure file transfer application"
    ```

4.  **Connect your local folder to your online GitHub repository:**
    ```powershell
    git remote add origin https://github.com/eshu1234m/secure-file-transfer.git
    ```

5.  **Finally, upload all your code to GitHub:**
    ```powershell
    git push -u origin main
